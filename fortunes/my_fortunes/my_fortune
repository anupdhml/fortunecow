Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or 
fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, 
photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street 
signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things 
to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and 
theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is 
non-existent. And don’t bother concealing your thievery—celebrate it if you
feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: 'It's
not where you take things from—it’s where you take them to.' "
~Jim Jarmusch

"Song"
By John Donne

Go and catch a falling star,
    Get with child a mandrake root,
Tell me where all past years are,
    Or who cleft the devil's foot,
Teach me to hear mermaids singing,
Or to keep off envy's stinging,
            And find
            What wind
Serves to advance an honest mind.

If thou be'st born to strange sights,
    Things invisible to see,
Ride ten thousand days and nights,
    Till age snow white hairs on thee,
Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,
All strange wonders that befell thee,
            And swear,
            No where
Lives a woman true, and fair.

If thou find'st one, let me know,
    Such a pilgrimage were sweet;
Yet do not, I would not go,
    Though at next door we might meet;
Though she were true, when you met her,
And last, till you write your letter,
            Yet she
            Will be
False, ere I come, to two, or three.
