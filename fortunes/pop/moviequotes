suicide some time.  You might learn a little something about the insurance 
business.

Edward S. Norton:  Mister Keyes, I was RAISED in the insurance business.

Keyes:  Yeah, in the front office.  Come now, you've never read an 
actuarial table in your life, have you?  Why they've got ten volumes on 
suicide alone.  Suicide by race, by colour, by occupation, by sex, by 
seasons of the year, by time of day.  Suicide, how committed: by poison, by 
firearms, by drowning, by leaps.  Suicide by poison, subdivided by TYPES of 
poison, such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, alkaloid, 
protein, and so forth.  Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high 
places, under the wheels of trains, under the wheels of trucks, under the 
feet of horses, from STEAMBOATS.  But, Mr. Norton: Of all the cases on 
record, there's not one single case of suicide by leap from the rear end of 
a moving train.  And you know how fast that train was going at the point 
where the body was found?  Fifteen miles an hour.  Now how can anybody jump 
off a slow-moving train like that with any kind of expectation that he 
would kill himself?  No, no soap, Mr. Norton.  We're sunk, and we'll have 
to pay through the nose, and you know it.

The universe grows smaller every day, and the threat of aggression by any 
group, anywhere, can no longer be tolerated.  There must be security for 
all, or no one is secure.  Now, this does not mean giving up any freedom, 
except the freedom to act irresponsibly.  Your ancestors knew this, when 
they made laws to govern themselves, and hired policemen to enforce them.  
We, of the other planets, have long accepted this principle.  We have an 
organisation for the mutual protection of all planets, and for the complete 
elimination of aggression.  The test of any such higher authority, is, of 
course, the police force that supports it.  For our policemen, we created a 
race of robots.  Their function is to patrol the planets in space-ships 
like this one and preserve the peace.  In matters of aggression, we have 
given them absolute power over us ...  this power cannot be revoked.  At 
the first sign of violence, they act automatically against the aggressor.  
The penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk.  The result 
is, we live in peace; without arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that 
we are free from aggression and war; free to pursue more profitable 
enterprises.  Now, we do not pretend to have achieved perfection, but we do 
have a system, and it works.  I came here to give you these facts.  It is 
no concern of ours how you run your own planet, but if you threaten to 
extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out 
cinder.  Your choice is simple - join us and live in peace, or pursue your 
present course and face obliteration.  We shall be waiting for your answer. 
 The decision rests with you.

badly wounded pilot from one of the raids.  He looked at me and said, "Doc,
the odds were against us up there, but we went in anyway.  I'm glad.
Captain made the right decision." The pilot's name was George Zip.

the crew is up against it, and the breaks are beating the boys, tell 'em to

Inigo Montoya:  My father was slaughtered by a six-fingered man.  He was a 
great swordmaker, my father.  When the six-fingered man appeared and 
requested a special sword.  My father took the job.  He slaved a year 
before it was done.

[Shows the Man in Black the sword]

Man in Black:  I've never seen its equal.

Inigo Montoya:  The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one 
tenth his promised price, my father refused.  Without a word, the 
six-fingered man slashed him through the heart.  I loved my father.  So 
naturally, I challenged his murderer to a duel.  I failed.  The 
six-fingered man left me alive, but he gave me these. [strokes the scars on 
his cheeks]

Man in Black:  How old were you?

Montoya:  I was eleven years old.  And when I was strong enough, I 
dedicated my life to the study of fencing.  So the next time we meet, I 
will not fail.  I will go up to the six-fingered man and say, "Hello.  My 
name is Inigo Montoya.  You killed my father.  Prepare to die."

Man in Black:  All right.  Where is the poison?  The battle of wits has 
begun.  It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is 
right... and who is dead.

Vizzini:  But it's so simple.  All I have to do is divine from what I know 
of you:  are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own 
goblet or his enemy's?  Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own 
goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what 
he was given.  I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine 
in front of you.  But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would 
have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

Man in Black:  You've made your decision then?

Vizzini:  Not remotely.  Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone 
knows, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are 
used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me, so I 
can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.  

Man in Black:  Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.

Vizzini:  Wait till I get going!  Now, where was I?

Man in Black:  Australia.

Vizzini:  Yes, Australia.  And you must have suspected I would have known 
the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

Man in Black:  You're just stalling now.

Vizzini:  You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, 
which means you're exceptionally strong, so you could've put the poison in 
your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you, so I can clearly 
not choose the wine in front of you.  But, you've also bested my Spaniard, 
which means you must have studied, and in studying you must have learned 
that man is mortal, so you would have put the poison as far from yourself 
as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

Man in Black:  You're trying to trick me into giving away something.  It 
won't work.

Vizzini:  IT HAS WORKED!  YOU'VE GIVEN EVERYTHING AWAY!  I KNOW WHERE THE 
POISON IS!

Man in Black:  Then make your choice.

Vizzini:  I will, and I choose - What in the world can that be?

Man in Black: [Vizzini gestures up and away from the table.  Roberts looks. 
 Vizzini swaps the goblets]

Man in Black:  What?  Where?  I don't see anything.

Vizzini:  Well, I- I could have sworn I saw something.  No matter.  First, 
let's drink.  Me from my glass, and you from yours.

Man in Black, Vizzini: [Vizzini and the Man in Black drink]

Man in Black:  You guessed wrong.

Vizzini:  You only think I guessed wrong!  That's what's so funny!  I 
switched glasses when your back was turned!  Ha ha!  You fool!  You fell 
victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is "never 
get involved in a land war in Asia" - but only slightly less well-known is 
this:  "Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line"!  Ha ha 
ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha...

Vizzini: [Vizzini stops suddenly, his smile frozen on his face and falls to 
the ground dead]

Buttercup:  Farm boy, polish my horse's saddle.  I want to see my face 
shining in it by morning.

Westley:  As you wish.

Grandpa: [voiceover] "As you wish" was all he ever said to her.

Buttercup:  Farm boy, fill these with water - please.

Westley:  As you wish.

Grandpa: [voiceover] That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was 
saying "As you wish", what he meant was, "I love you." And even more 
amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back.

Buttercup:  Farm boy... fetch me that pitcher.

Westley: [reaches above her] As you wish.

Archie:  Wanda, do you have any idea what it's like being English?  Being
so correct all the time, being so stifled by this dread of, of doing the
wrong thing, of saying to someone "Are you married?" and hearing "My wife
left me this morning," or saying, uh, "Do you have children?" and being
told they all burned to death on Wednesday.  You see, Wanda, we'll all
terrified of embarrassment.  That's why we're so...  dead.  Most of my
friends are dead, you know, we have these piles of corpses to dinner.  But
you're alive, God bless you, and I want to be, I'm so fed up with all this.
I want to make love with you, Wanda.  I'm a good lover - at least, used to
be, back in the early 14th century.  Can we go to bed?

Wanda:  Yeah.

President Andrew Shepherd:  Are you attracted to me?

Sydney:  I beg your pardon?

Shepherd:  I asked if you were attracted to me.

Sydney:  That's not the issue.

Shepherd:  Well, I tell you what, let's make it the issue.  Let's try
something new, because I know that most couples when they first get
together are inclined to slam on the brakes because they're concerned about
Bob Rumson's drool.

President Andrew Shepherd:  You're attracted to me, but the idea of
physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the
President.  But it's not always going to be that way, and the reason I know
that is there was a moment last night when you were with ME, not the
President.  And I know what a big step that was for you.  So, Sydney, I'm
in no rush.  Here's my plan.  We're going to slow down, and when you're
comfortable, that's when it's going to happen.

[Sydney emerges from the bathroom wearing nothing but one of his shirts.]

Shepherd:  Perhaps I didn't properly explain the fundamentals of the
slowdown plan.

Sydney Ellen Wade: [feeling the bed] No, you explained it great.

Shepherd:  Are you nervous?

Sydney:  No.

Shepherd:  Good.  My nervousness exists on...  several levels.  Number one,
and this is in no particular order, I haven't done this in a pretty long
time.  Number two, uh, any expectations that you might have, given the fact
that I'm...  you know...

Sydney: [approaching seductively] The most powerful man in the world?

Shepherd:  Exactly, thank you.  I think it's important you remember that's
a political distinction; it comes with the office.  I mean, if, uh,
Eisenhower were here instead of me, he'd be dead by now.

question he is trying to ask is...

Joss:  Do you believe in God?

don't believe there's data either way.

Palmer Joss:  Our job was to select someone to speak for everybody.  And I
just couldn't in good conscience vote for a person who doesn't believe in
God.  Someone who honestly thinks the other ninety five percent of us
suffer from some form of mass delusion.

idealism you showed at the hearing was rewarded, not taken advantage of.
Unfortunately, we don't live in that world.

Kate:  It's just a toaster!

charcoal.  So, clearly, to make proper toast it requires one and a half 
insertions, which is something for which the apparatus doesn't begin to 
allow!  One assumes that when the General of Electric built it, he might 
have tried using it.  One assumes the General might take pride in his 
creations instead of just foisting them on an unsuspecting public.

sitting up at the counter weighs two hundred fifteen pounds and knows how 
to handle himself. I know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of

Morpheus:  Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us, but
if we are to be prepared for it we must first shed our fear of it.  I stand
here, before you now, truthfully unafraid.  Why?  Because I believe
something you do not?  No!  I stand here without fear because I remember.
I remember that I stand here, not because of the path that lies before me
but because of the path that lies behind me.  I remember that for one
hundred years we have fought these machines.  I remember that for one
hundred years they have sent their armies to destroy us, and after a
century of war I remember that which matters most:  we are still HERE.

Neo:  Are there other programs like you?

The Oracle:  Oh, well, not like me.  But...  look, see those birds?  At
some point a program was written to govern them.  A program was written to
watch over the trees; and the wind; the sunrise and sunset.  There are
programs running all over the place.  The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.  You'd never even know they were
here.  But the other ones, well, we hear about them all the time.

Neo:  I've never heard of them.

The Oracle:  Of course you have.  Every time you've heard someone say they
saw a ghost, or an angel.  Every story you've ever heard about vampires,
werewolves, or aliens, is the system assimilating some program that's doing
something they're not supposed to be doing.

The Architect:  Hello Neo.

Neo:  Who are you?

The Architect:  I am the Architect.  I created the matrix.  I've been
waiting for you.  You have many questions, and although the process has
altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human.  Ergo, some of my
answers you will understand, and some of them you will not.  Concordantly,
while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not
realize it is also the *most* irrelevant.

     # The Matrix Reloaded (2003)

%
Neo:  Why am I here?

The Architect:  Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced
equation inherent to the programming of the matrix.  You are the
eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have
been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of
mathematical precision.  While it remains a burden assiduously avoided,
it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control.  Which
has led you, inexorably, here.

Neo:  You haven't answered my question.

The Architect:  Quite right.  Interesting.  That was quicker than the
others.

     # The Matrix Reloaded (2003)

Neo:  There are only two possible explanations:  either no-one told me, or
no-one knows.

     # The Matrix Reloaded (2003)

The Architect:  The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect.
It was a work of art.  Flawless.  Sublime.  A triumph only equalled by its
monumental failure.

     # The Matrix Reloaded (2003)

%
The Architect:  The function of the One is now to return to the source,
allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting
the prime program.  After which you will be required to select from the
matrix 23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion.  Failure to
comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash
killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the
extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the
entire human race.

Neo:  You won't let it happen, you can't.  You need human beings to
survive.

     # The Matrix Reloaded (2003)

%
The Architect:  There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept
the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.

     # The Matrix Reloaded (2003)

simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest
weakness.

Teacher:  Earth that was could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so 
many.  We found a new solar system, dozens of planets and hundreds of 
moons.  Each one terraformed, a process taking decades, to support human 
life, to be new Earths.  The Central Planets formed the Alliance.  Ruled by 
an interplanetary parliament, the Alliance was a beacon of civilization.  
The savage outer planets were not so enlightened and refused Alliance 
control.  The war was devastating, but the Alliance's victory over the 
Independents ensured a safer universe.  And now everyone can enjoy the 
comfort and enlightenment of our civilization.

John Harrison: Mr. Spock. The mind of the Enterprise. The fearless genius 
who ensures a calm force of intelligence guides their every mission.  But 
look deeper and you will see an outsider who does not belong, a man of two 
worlds. This tears him apart, the constant battle between what he thinks 
and what he feels. What does he do? Does he follow his head, embracing 
logic and the path of reason? Or does he follow his heart, knowing the 
emotions he cannot control may destroy him? I will help him decide...

Capt. James T. Kirk: Why would a Starfleet admiral ask a 
three-hundred-year-old frozen man for help?

John Harrison: Because I am better.

Kirk: At what?

John Harrison: Everything. Alexander Marcus needed to respond to an 
uncivilized threat in a civilized time, and for that, he needed a warrior's 
mind - my mind - to design weapons and warships.

Spock: You are suggesting the Admiral violated every regulation he vowed to 
uphold, simply because he wanted to exploit your intellect...

John Harrison: He wanted to exploit my savagery! Intellect alone is useless 
in a fight, Mr. Spock. You, you can't even break a rule - how can you be 
expected to break bone? Marcus used me to design weapons. I helped him 
realize his vision of a militarized Starfleet. He sent you to use those 
weapons, to fire my torpedoes on an unsuspecting planet, and then he 
purposely crippled your ship in enemy space, leading to one inevitable 
outcome: the Klingons would come searching for whoever was responsible, and 
you would have no chance of escape. Marcus would finally have the war he 
talked about, the war he always wanted.

Spock: We have no transporter capabilities.

John Harrison: Fortunately mine are perfectly functioning. Drop your 
shields.

Spock: If I do so I have no guarantee that you will not destroy the 
Enterprise.

John Harrison: Well, let's play this out logically then, Mr. Spock.  
Firstly, I will kill your captain to demonstrate my resolve, then if yours 
holds I will have no choice but to kill you and your entire crew.

Spock: If you destroy our ship, you will also destroy your own people.

John Harrison: Your crew requires oxygen to survive, mine does not. I will 
target your life support systems located behind the aft nacelle. And after 
every single person aboard your ship suffocates, I will walk over your cold 
corpses to recover my people. Now, shall we begin?

Spock: ...Lower shields.

John Harrison: A wise choice, Mr. Spock. I see all 72 torpedoes are still 
in their tubes. If they're not mine, Commander, I will know it.

his consciousness and experienced what he felt at the moment of his 
passing. Anger. Confusion. Loneliness. Fear. I had experiences those 
feelings before, multiplied exponentially on the day my planet was

Capt. James T. Kirk: There will always be those who mean to do us harm.  To 
stop them, we risk awakening the same evil within ourselves. Our first 
instinct is to seek revenge when those we love are taken from us. But 
that's not who we are... When Christopher Pike first gave me his ship, he 
had me recite the Captain's Oath. Words I didn't appreciate at the time. 
But now I see them as a call for us to remember who we once were and who we 
must be again. And those words: Space, the final frontier. These are the 
voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her five-year mission: to explore 
strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly 
go where no one has gone before.

Spock: Captain, without your display compass, hitting your target 
destination is mathematically impossible.

manner.

Capt. James T. Kirk: You filed a report? Why didn't you tell me?

Spock: I incorrectly assumed that you would be truthful in your captain's 
log.

Kirk: Yeah, I would have been if I didn't have to save your life.

Spock: A fact for which I am grateful immeasurably grateful and the very 
reason to take responsibility for the actions...

Kirk: Take responsibility, yeah. That'd be so noble, pointy, if you were 
also throwing me under the bus.

Spock: "Pointy"? Is that a derogatory reference to me?

Capt. James T. Kirk: How did you find me?

Admiral Christopher Pike: I know you better than you think you do. The 
first time I found you was in a dive like this. Remember that? You got your 
ass handed to you.

Kirk: No, I didn't.

Pike: You don't.

Kirk: No, that's not what happened.

Pike: That was an epic beating.

Kirk: No, it wasn't.

Pike: You had napkins hanging out of your nose. Did you not?

Kirk: Yeah, that was a good fight.

Spock: Mr. Spock.

Spock Prime: Mr. Spock.

Spock: I will be brief. In your travels, did you ever encounter a man named 
Khan?

Spock Prime: As you know, I have made a vow never to give you information 
that could potentially alter your destiny. Your path is yours to walk, and 
yours alone. That being said, Khan Noonien Singh is the most dangerous 
adversary the Enterprise ever faced. He is brilliant, ruthless and he will 
not hesitate to kill every single one of you.

Spock: Did you defeat him?

Spock Prime: At great cost, yes.

Capt. James T. Kirk: Let me explain what's happening here: you are a 
criminal! I watched you murder innocent men and women! I was authorized to 
END you! And the only reason why you are still alive is because I am 
allowing it. So SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

Noonien Singh: Captain, are you going to punch me again, over and over, 
until your arm weakens... clearly you want to. So tell me, why did you 
allow me to live?

Kirk: We all make mistakes.

Khan: I surrendered to you because, despite your attempt to convince me 
otherwise, you seem to have a conscience, Mr. Kirk. If you did not, then it 
would be impossible for me to convince you of the truth. 23174611. 
Coordinates not far from Earth. If you want to know why I did what I did, 
go and take a look.

Kirk: Give me one reason why I should listen to you.

Khan: I can give you 72. And they're on board your ship, Captain.  They 
have been, all along.
