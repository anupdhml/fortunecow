He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand?"
Stan: "But then, why does God give us anything to start with?"
Chef: "Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then you would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power."

Announcer of the ADA: Fellow dentists! As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth-fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this: A giant half-chicken, half-squirrel, that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest, for genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring. We believe also, that the creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra, and that it...
Dr Foley: Excuse me, I think I have a more logical theory!
Announcer of the ADA: Well, by all means, Mr Foley, enlighten us!
Dr Foley: I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit!
Announcer of the ADA: [all laughing] Oh, Mr Foley! You realize how ridiculous that sounds?!
Dr Foley: It's not ridiculous, it's very possible. I've seen it happen before!
Announcer of the ADA: Where?
Dr Foley: In Montreal.
Announcer of the ADA: [more laughing] And where, pray, is this "Montreal"?
Dr Foley: Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!
Announcer of the ADA: Very well, Mr Foley! You go on your wild goose chase, and meanwhile we'll deal with the real problems at hand.
Dr Foley: I will! [leaves]
Announcer of the ADA: Ha ha ha! Anyway, the half-chicken, half-squirrel would most likely be about 3-4.5 feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a floatation device...

Lead Agent: [to NAMBLA leader] We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?

They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live. You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand.

NAMBLA Leader: We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away.

Cartman: [begins to wolf down the food] God, this is really good, Scott!
Scott: I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have something to tell you.
Cartman: [through a mouthful of chili] What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? [everyone at Scott's end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation]
Scott: What?
Cartman: Yes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. [Chef looks like he's been used] It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. [Stan and Kyle are stunned] I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. [a shot of Cartman talking to Denkins, who is armed] I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. [a shot of Scott talking with his parents] And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. [the Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the "starving" pony. Seeing Mr. Tenorman's lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them; they go down]
Mr. Denkins: [looks of horror surround him] Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I-I have my rights.
Scott: My...mom and dad are...dead? [a shot of Officer Barbrady taking a report from Denkins]
Cartman: I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... [a shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away] After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could personally tell you about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. [more faces of horror behind Cartman] Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? [a gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."
Scott: [looks at Cartman for a while, realizing what's just happened] Oh my God! [gagging, he fishes through the plate and finds his mom's wedding ring, still on her finger; he tosses it away] Oh my God! [vomits off to the side]
Cartman: [leaping up on the table and sings] Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are stunned]

Kyle: Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
Stan: Good call.

But I have a great life and a great family and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up. Because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls.

Cartman: Uh-huh, so you want to join the fan club now? Our first meeting is tomorrow at 5.30pm...
Stan: No, no, no, we want our money back!
Cartman: What?
Stan: We thought the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our $18! Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
Cartman: You thought it sucked!? Sir, apparently you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do; he was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew! It has made people the world over open their eyes!
Stan: Look kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so just tell us how we can get in touch with Mel Gibson and get our money back!
Cartman: If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir! All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu, now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick!
Stan: [furious] Hey don't take that tone with me kid, I'll kick your ass!
Cartman: Yeah, I'd like to see you try asshole, I'm like six feet tall!
Stan: I don't care, you sound like a little bitch to me!
Cartman: Bitch!? Don't call me bitch, I'll pop your fucking head open!
Stan: Yeah, you wanna bring it, you little pussy!?
Cartman: I already brought it bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Stan: [realisising] Wait a minute! Cartman!? [Cartman hangs up]

Mr. Stotch: Bring him back? Wha-what are you talking about?
Old Man: I know you're thinkin' of puttin' him up there, in the Indian burial ground up that road. You're thinkin' if you bury his body there it'll come back to life. Sometimes dead is better.
Mr. Stotch: Indian burial ground?
Old Man: It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of. The Nelson boy, back in '85.
Mr. Stotch: You're saying if I dig up my son's body and rebury him at the old Indian burial ground, that-
Old Man: Don't do it, Stotch! What comes out of the ground ain't the thing you put in. The Indians knew that, that's why they stopped usin' it when the ground went sour. I'm just here to talk you out of it. [heads for the door] Don't bury your son's body at the Indian burial ground, Stotch! The one that's right up over there, by the Andersons' barn.

So retard fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its mutant fish hands, and it had butt-sex with a squirrel or something, and made this...retard frog-squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a monkey-fish-frog, and then this monkey-fish-frog had butt-sex with that monkey; that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and that made you.

Randy: Oh, God. Oh, here it comes. [goes for the final push, which has him pushing himself off the toilet seat by his hands several times] Whoa, hot! Hot, hot! Whoaaa, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! [a view from the street. Randy's moans can be heard; he can be seen moving about] Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa, hot! Hot, hot, hot-hot-hot-hot, hot, hot!!

[puts his briefs and pants back up in place] I feel so much better. Oh. [a view from within the toilet: Randy turns around to flush, but stops, looks down, and crouches down for a better look] Wow! That...is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He--Hey, Sharon. Sharon, you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?

Bono: I have the first-place trophy for that.
Stan: [surprised] Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of fuck off?

[Cartman is looking for a leprechaun. If he sees it, Kyle will suck his balls; if not, he will owe Kyle $10. This is the plot of the whole trilogy]
Kyle: This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
Cartman: [setting up a trip wire between two stones] It isn't a story; it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now. [drops the rope, walks forward, and whips out a walkie-talkie] Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
Clyde: This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by.
[Jimmy, Jason, and Craig are hoisting the net into place]
Cartman: Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out.
Kyle: Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
Cartman: Oho, no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember? [whips out his walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Blackie. What's your six, Blackie?
Token: [rather pissed off] I don't want the code name "Blackie."
Cartman: Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! [puts away the walkie talkie and gets back to setting the trip wire]
Kyle: This is fucking retarded!
Cartman: Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechaun shows up, you must suck my balls. Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. [finishes setting the trip wire]
Kyle: Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me $10! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
Cartman: [whispering loudly] Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet? [whips out the walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
Butters: [on a lookout platform with a telescope next to him; in subdued manner] This is Faggot. Go ahead.
Cartman: Faggot, I need you to keep surveillance north to northeast. Check back in five.
Butters: Okay, will do. Faggot out. [turns right and looks through the telescope, then exclaims]
Kyle: Okay, that's enough. Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
Cartman: It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
Kyle: You didn't see a leprechaun, fat ass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Butters: Uh, I got somethin'! I got it! [the other boys turn and pay attention] It's, uh, oh, jeez, I think it's a leprechaun!
Cartman: [to Token] Set off diversion track C! [Token sets off a small bomb under a pile of leaves. Nearby a leprechaun skips into view, then stops upon seeing the boys]
Stan: Dude.
Jimmy: F-Fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
Cartman: [charging forth] Get it! [the leprechaun runs away, and the boys give chase] Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive!
[the leprechaun crawls under a tree trunk and gets up. He trips over a rope and a net descends on him; he dodges it and runs off. He runs into a bush and trips a sliding door, which drops down behind him. It traps him in a cage. He looks around for a way out, but sees the boys crowd in]
Butters: Wow.
Stan: Cool.
Craig: No way.
Token: Whoa.
Jason: Wow.
Cartman: [making his way through, out of breath] Agh. Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
Leprechaun: You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
Cartman: [gets out a Bowie knife] Tell me where the gold is or you die! [unsheaths it] Slow!
[the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him out and disappears]
Stan: Where'd he go?
[the leprechaun appears on a tree limb behind the boys; they turn to look at him again]
Leprechaun: I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near! [makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him away and disappears]
Craig: Dude.
Cartman: [walks up to Kyle and clears his throat] Kyle, suck my balls. [brings out the contract both of them signed. Kyle stands motionless]

General: If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet leprechauns aren't real. So why do you care if something happens?
Kyle: Because I-- Because I think they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same can be said for Bugs Bunny and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the earth. Doesn't that make them kind of real? They might be imaginary, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around till long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. [Cartman starts applauding, followed by everyone else]
General: [touched] Abort the sequence. [scientist does so]

Well, I have decided, Cartman, that even if we did have a bet, that I am NEVER going to suck your balls! [grabs Cartman by the scruff of his neck] You got that?!
